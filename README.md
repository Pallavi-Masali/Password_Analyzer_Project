# Password_Analyzer_Project
The Password Strength Analyzer with Custom Wordlist Generator is a cybersecurity tool designed to evaluate the strength of user passwords and generate personalized wordlists for ethical testing and training purposes.

The analyzer measures password robustness using entropy calculations and the zxcvbn algorithm to estimate crack time and provide feedback on password quality. Users can input personal information such as names, dates, or pet names to create custom wordlists that include common variations like leetspeak and appended years.

The tool can operate through a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical interface (GUI) built with Tkinter. It provides results in real time and exports wordlists in .txt format for further security testing.

Overall, this project promotes password awareness, security education, and helps cybersecurity learners understand how attackers may exploit weak passwords â€” all within ethical boundaries.
